Orders
A tasking order is a request to capture new imagery of a specific area of interest (AOI) within a given time of interest (TOI). Tasking orders are not to be confused with Scene and Basemap Orders offered by the Planet Orders API.

Point and LineString inputs will be will be expanded into a circular or rectangle Polygon respectively to serve as the area of interest for this order. The expansion size defaults to 5 km for SkySat imagery but can vary based on product parameters. Required for all orders except Assured Tasking orders.

pl_number	
string or null (Contract number) non-empty
Contract number of the order. Required if you have access to multiple products or contracts.

Imaging Windows
An imaging window is a distinct opportunity for imagery to be taken by a specific satellite as it passes over an area of interest (AOI) at a given time of interest (TOI). Submitting an Assured Tasking order requires you to specify an imaging window.

Retrieve Imaging Windows Deprecated
Retrieve the available imaging windows after completing a synchronous (blocking) imaging window search using the search_id returned from the initial search request as a query parameter.

This operation is deprecated. Please create an asynchronous imaging windows search request instead.
